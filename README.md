# AtlasAPI
Simple API that talks with MongoDB atlas with use of Pandas aswell

This is my MongoDB (ATLAS) API that can be deployed via Docker, using the pymongo,panda,dotenv libraries.
Its purpose is to create an API; that will allow a user to Add new entries in reference to Name and Age, delele those entries, return them to screen and copy the collections -
contents to a locally sotred and created CSV file. ( This was done by using Pandas )
